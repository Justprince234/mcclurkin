                                Our Toronto civil litigation lawyers handle legal disputes involving:<br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Class Action Lawsuits</b> representing consumers or a &quot;class&quot; of people, or representing the defendant company in complex, nationwide litigation

                                <b>Shareholder Disputes </b>among business partners, medical practice group members, and investors<br>
                                <b>Patent Infringement</b> and other intellectual property disputes and violations, including trademark and copyright disputes<br>

                                <br>
                                <b>Internet Litigation:</b> This is a relatively new area of law and FORSTMANN Solicitors LLP is leading the way in advising clients on strategies to minimize or avoid reputation management problems online, as well as with
                                Internet litigation involving:<br>
                                <br> Takedown disputes (getting content removed from Web sites, including sites such as YouTube) Domain name disputes,Trademark and copyright disputes over material on the Web Defamation, libel, slander, business disparagement
                                and privacy/publicity claims.<br>
                                <br> Reputation management is a significant area for many individuals and companies. If you find yourself on the wrong side of technologically adept and unhappy customer or adversary, your business or personal life could
                                face serious problems. It is extremely difficult to get content removed from a Web site but interactive sites do have terms and conditions, rules and laws under which they operate (such as the DMAlabama (Digital Millennium
                                Copyright Act)). There are mechanisms that can be used to provide force to a takedown notice.<br>
                                <br> Our litigation practice uses state of the art information systems that allow access to all relevant filings, documents, and testimony pertaining to your case with the click of a button. Our investment in technology
                                enhances our ability to present your case to a judge or a jury and to respond to each move the opposition makes.

                                to handle your business legal issues is as important as choosing a business partner: it takes trust, common goals and communication. Your success is, in part, dependent on the quality of the legal advice you receive, whether
                                it is about a breach of contract or a choice of entity. We serve a cross-section of businesses throughout the country: women- and minority-owned businesses, new and established businesses and business people who need legal
                                advice on problems regarding everything from business formation to breach of contract. Corporate law is a large and diverse legal sector, but with a commercial lawyer that cares for your brand, you can ensure that your
                                business meets the standards of government legislation and conducts its affairs to the letter of the law.</p>
